#User agents
#
#You may find that some feeds don’t return any information when you use Newsbeuter, probably because# the user agent string it sends is not recognised as an RSS reader. The feed for the Abstruse Goose# comic is an example, as is Toothpaste for Dinner.
#
#The easiest way to work around this is to make Newsbeuter identify itself as a better-known RSS rea#der. I’ve found that pretending to be Liferea works:
#
#user-agent "Liferea/1.4.14 (Linux; en_US.UTF8; http://liferea.sf.net/)"
#With this done and Newsbeuter restarted, the feeds seem more willing to yield their items for readi#ng.
